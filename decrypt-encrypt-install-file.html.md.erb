title: Decrypting and Encrypting Installation Files
---

This topic is intended for product teams who package, distribute, and upgrade [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) products across releases.

This topic describes the installation and product template YAML files in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Operations Manager VM. It also provides instructions on viewing and modifying the installation YAML files so that product teams can migrate content.

##<a id='understand-files'></a> Understanding Ops Manager Installation and Product Template Files ##

During the installation process, Ops Manager combines information from the installation and product template YAML files to generate the manifests that define your deployment.

**Installation files**: PCF stores user-entered data and automatically generated values for Ops Manager in installation files. PCF encrypts and stores these files in the directory `/var/tempest/workspaces/default`.

You must decrypt them to view the contents, edit the files as necessary for your content migration, then re-encrypt them.

**Product templates**: Ops Manager uses product templates to create forms and obtain user input. The `job_types` and `property_blueprint` key-value pairs in a product template determine how the `jobs` and `properties` sections display in the installation file. Ops Manager stores product templates in the directory `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/metadata`.

You can edit these files. User input does not alter these files.

1. Log in to the Ops Manager VM using SSH and the correct username for your IaaS.

    **AWS**: Replace `REMOTE_SERVER` with the IP address for your Ops Manager VM. When prompted, provide your `ops_manager` SSH key information that you created when configuring AWS components for PCF.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ ssh ubuntu@REMOTE_SERVER
    </pre>

    **VMWare IaaS Product**: Replace `REMOTE_SERVER` with the IP address for your Ops Manager VM. Also provide the admin password that you set when you installed Ops Manager to your vSphere, vCloud Air, or vCloud IaaS. For more information, refer to the following:
    * vCloud Air and vCloud: Refer to the step on defining password information for the Ops Manager vApp in the [Complete the vApp Wizard and Deploy Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/pcf-vchs-vcloud.html#deploying-from-catalog) section of the _Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud_ topic.
    * vSphere: Refer to the step on defining password information for the VM admin user in the [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/deploying-vm.html) topic.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ ssh tempest@REMOTE_SERVER
    tempest@REMOTE_SERVER's password:
    </pre>

1. `cd` into the directory `/var/tempest/workspace/default/metadata` on the Ops Manager VM.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cd /var/tempest/workspace/default/metadata`
    </pre>

1. Clone the encryption/decryption script files from the GitHub `pivotal-cf encrypt-decrypt scripts` repository:

    <pre class="terminal">
    sudo git clone https://github.com/pivotal-cf/encrypt-decrypt-scripts
    </pre>

    This repo contains the following files:
    * `decrypt-ops.sh`
    * `encrypt-ops.sh`
    * `eos.rb`

1. Use `sudo cp` to copy the files to the protected `/var/tempest/workspaces/default` parent directory.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo cp *.sh ..
    $ sudo cp eos.rb /..
    </pre>

1. `cd` up to the `/var/tempest/workspaces/default` directory.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cd ..
    </pre>

1. Change the permissions of the `decrypt-ops.sh` and `encrypt-ops.sh` scripts.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo chmod 755 decrypt.sh
    $ sudo chmod 755 encrypt.sh
    </pre>

1. Run the `decrypt` command to create the `decrypted-installation.yml` and `decrypted-installed.yml` files.

    Replace `PASSWORD` with your Ops Manager UserID password.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo ./decrypt.sh PASSWORD
    </pre>

    This script does the following:
     * Searches the `/var/tempest/workspaces/default` for the installation YAML files and creates decrypted copies.
     * Creates a directory `decrypted` and stores the decrypted files in this directory.


1. Review and edit the files as necessary for your content migration.


1. Run the `encrypt` command on the modified decrypted files.

    Replace `PASSWORD` with your Ops Manager UserID password.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo ./encrypt.sh PASSWORD
    </pre>

    This script encrypts the decrypted files and stores the resulting output in the `/var/tempest/workspaces/default` directory, which overwrites the existing `installation.yml` file and adds a new file, `installed-installation.yml`. `encrypt-ops.sh` does not overwrite the `actual-installation.yml` file.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that you back up the edited and encrypted <code>installation.yml</code> and <code>installed-installation.yml</code> files for future reference.</p>

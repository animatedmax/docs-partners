This document will explore how migrations are made from one version of a product to another.

This document will be completed soon. In the meantime please review the migration format in the [example product](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/ops-manager-example/releases), as well as in the [Pivotal Elastic Runtime](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime) tile.

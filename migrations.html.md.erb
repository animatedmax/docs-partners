This topic discusses product tile migrations, which refer to changing the name and values of properties when a user upgrades tile versions. 

See the migration format in the [example product](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/ops-manager-example/releases), as well as in the [Pivotal Elastic Runtime](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime) tile.

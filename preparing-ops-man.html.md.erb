 <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: This topic is part of the [Creating a Pivotal Cloud Foundry® Product Tile](./creating.html) tutorial.  Before beginning this procedure, you should follow the procedure described in [Deploying a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).</p>

This topic describes how to deploy the PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and configure Ops Manager Director. Ops Manager uses BOSH to deploy software products in [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf).

The Ops Manager Installation Dashboard is the interface that hosts Ops Manager Director and other product tiles.

## <a id='deploy-ops-manager'></a>Step 1: Deploy Ops Manager

Download the latest Ops Manager from a shared AMI (Amazon Machine Image) on AWS, and launch it on the VPC you already created in [Deploying a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).

1. Log in to [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io), click the **Ops Manager** tile, and download the instructions for deploying Ops Manager on AWS. Open the PDF and record the AMI ID listed for your nearest region. You can ignore the rest of the instructions.

1. Log into AWS, navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**, and click **Launch Instance**.

1. Click **Community AMIs** in the left column and search for the AMI ID you recorded from the Ops Manager instructions.
    <%= image_tag 'ami_selection_aws.png' %>

1. Click the **Select** button next to this Ops Manager AMI.

1. Choose `m3.large` as the instance type for your Ops Manager VM, and click **Next: Configure Instance Details** at bottom right.

1. Click the **Network** dropdown and choose the VPC for ExampleStack that you created in [Deploying a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html#prep-environment).

1. Click the **Subnet** dropdown and choose the public subnet that you created in [Deploying a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html#prep-environment).

1. Set **Auto-assign Public IP** to **Enable**.
<%= image_tag 'vpc.png' %>

1. Click **Review and Launch**.

1. On the Review Instance Launch page, click **Edit Security Group**.

1. On the Configure Security Group page, click **Select an existing security group** and then select the ExampleStack group created in [Deploying a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).
    <%= image_tag 'sec-group.png' %>

1. Click **Review and Launch**.

1. On the Review Instance Launch page, click **Launch**.

1. In the key pair drop-down menu, select **ExampleKeyPair**, the key pair you created in [Deploying a Pivotal Cloud Foundry Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html).

1. Select the acknowledgment checkbox and click **Launch Instances**.
    <%= image_tag 'keypair.png' %>

1. Create a DNS entry for the IP address for your Ops Manager interface. You must use this fully qualified domain name (FQDN) when you log into Ops Manager.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To create a FQDN in AWS, navigate to your hosted zone in the **Route 53** dashboard and create a new `A` record associating a domain to IP address of your Ops Man instance. To find this address in the **EC2 Dashboard** > **Instances** select the `m3.large` instance you created for Ops Manager and record the value for **Public IP**.</p>

## <a id='configure-install'></a>Step 2: Configure and Install Ops Manager Director

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name you created in the previous step.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * <strong>[Use an Identity Provider](#idp)</strong>: If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * <strong>[Internal Authentication](#internal)</strong>: If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

1. When redirected to the **Use an Identity Provider** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Retrieve the metadata URL from your Identity Provider and copy it into the **Use an Identity Provider** area.
    * Create a passphrase. The passphrase you entered is a shared secret to encrypt Ops Manager data at rest.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("meta-url.png") %>

1.  Your Identity Provider login page appears. Enter your username and password. Click **Login**.

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username** and **Admin password**.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if forgotten.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * If you are using an **Http proxy** or **Https proxy**, enter the proxy URL. If specified, Ops Manager will redirect traffic to a designated proxy server. If there are addresses that should not be used to access the proxy, enter them in the **No proxy** field. Pivotal recommends listing the Bosh Director IP address in the **No proxy field**. To find the Bosh Director IP address, navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** > **Instances**, select the instance named `bosh/0` and record its value for **Private IPs**.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>

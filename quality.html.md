# Release cycle

There are four typical and recommended stages to releasing a product to a customer.

The timelines for moving between each stage will vary by customer and depend upon your product and feature set. Based on experience though, we recommend allowing at least a month for the product to be in Public Beta before moving to GA. 

## Phase 0 - Alpha

This is the beginnings of your product, when it is in its development stage. The product may be under constant churn and refactoring and may not be feature complete.

You may be testing this internally, not with customers. So there are no quality requirements at this stage.

## Phase 1 - Closed Beta

Closed Beta is for when you have a version of your product that you feel is relatively stable and you are keen to get feedback on from customers.

It can be made available on [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io) to specific groups or individual customers upon request.

Being in closed beta gives you the freedom to make breaking changes, fix any big bugs, suffer potential data loss and advise the customer that they need to delete the tile in between versions.

This is useful as you receive customer feedback that may alter your approach to the product and features that you are delivering.

You may release multiple versions of the tile whilst you are in closed beta.

## Phase 2 - Public Beta

## Phase 3 - Generally Available

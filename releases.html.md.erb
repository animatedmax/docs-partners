title: The Pivotal Partner Software Product Release Cycle
---

This topic describes the four phases of product release to Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF).

## <a id='alpha'></a>Phase 1: Alpha

A product begins development in the **Alpha** phase. The product undergoes constant churn and refactoring, and may not be feature-complete.

Customers do not have exposure to a product during Alpha, and there are no quality requirements in this phase. Instead, developers utilize this stage for internal testing.

## <a id='closed-beta'></a>Phase 2:  Closed Beta

A limited pool of users gain access and provide feedback to a product during **Closed Beta**. This feedback drives further development.

A status of Closed Beta informs users that the product may be unstable and should not be used in production.

A product should remain in Closed Beta while:

- Changes may break product function or cause loss of data.
- Users may experience major bugs.
- Users may need to delete and reinstall tiles rather than upgrading them.

Developers make products in closed beta available to specific groups or individual customers on [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

### Requirements
Products in Closed Beta must meet the following requirements:

* The product must run properly on at least one IaaS. The supported infrastructures are AWS, vSphere and Openstack.

* The product tile must target the [stemcell version](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells) of the latest available Pivotal Ops Manager.

* The release notes must make clear the following constraints:

  * The potential data loss and lack of support make the product unsuitable for use in production.

  * Users will need to delete the old tile and install a new one in order to move to the next version of the product. No upgrade path exists.

Beyond these requirements, the product also requires substantial test coverage.

### Test Coverage
The product tile must validate the following test scenarios:

* Error free installation
* Complete deletion, without any trace remainders
* Valid stemcell reference available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells)
* The desired feature set functionally provides the desired feedback

With proper requirements and test coverage the product may move out of Closed Beta. 

### Create a New Release
The following steps create a new release for your product:

1. Log into [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

1. Create a new release for your product and populate all of the required fields.

1. Check that the release version states **BETA**.

1. Clearly describe in the release description that the product cannot be upgraded and users may suffer data loss.

1. E-mail your Pivotal contact to request product validation and release. Please provide basic instructions on how to validate the new feature set so they can make it viewable to customers.

## <a id='public-beta'></a>Phase 3: Public Beta

Your product will be made available to the general public in **Public Beta**. The wider pool of users increases public awareness and feedback and facilitates marketing and advertising. You may publish a series of product versions in Public Beta as development continues.

Your product qualifies for the **Public Beta** stage if it meets the following conditions:

- You have high confidence that further development will not break the product or incur data loss for users.
- The tile can be upgraded.
- You need user feedback to discover minor bugs and evaluate existing features.
- The product does not contain the full set of features intended for the final release.

Products in Public Beta are available on [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io) to any user with a free Pivotal Network account.

### Requirements
Products in Public Beta must meet the following requirements:

* The product meets all requirements for [**Closed Beta**](#closed-beta).

* The tile can be upgraded upon subsequent versions without requiring the customer to uninstall the previous version. 

* The product supports upgrade paths from any minor version or patch to the next minor version and any patches.

* The product must run properly on at least one IaaS. The supported infrastructures are AWS, vSphere and Openstack.

* Tile version upgrades result in no data or configuration loss.

* You can respond to discovery of a security flaw on the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/index.html) within a reasonable time frame. Security flaws include vulnerabilities in your stemcell or within one of the components of your tile. 
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal attempts to respond to all critical CVEs within 48 hours. 
</p>

* You feel comfortable supporting this tile for customers.

### Test Coverage
The product tile must validate the following test scenarios:

* Testing requirements for **Closed Beta** have been met.
* Upgrades work correctly.
* Tile version upgrades result in no data or configuration loss.
* Upgrades maintain service functionality and availability.
* Where appropriate, PCF integrations work properly, including:
  * Registered routes
  * UAA
  * Service brokers

### Steps to Release

1. Log into [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

1. Create a new release for your product and populate all of the required fields.

1. Check that the release version states **BETA**.

1. E-mail your Pivotal contact to request product validation and release. Please provide basic instructions on how to validate the new feature set. Pivotal will also validate the upgrade scenario and data persistence.

## <a id='ga'></a>Phase 4: General Availability

A product qualifies for **General Availability** when:

- It is production ready.

- You can charge money for this product and provide support guarantees to your customers.

- The full set of features meet the standards of quality that you wish to uphold.

### Requirements
Products must meet the following requirments for **General Availability**:

* The product meets all requirements for [**Public Beta**](#public-beta).
* You consider the product production ready.
* You can provide customer support.
* Your business team can "Go to market".
* The product can scale vertically.
* If appropriate, the product can scale horizontally for high availability.

### Test Coverage
The product tile must validate the following test scenarios:

* Testing requirements for **Public Beta** have been met.
* Vertical scaling, such as increasing the amount of RAM and/or CPU, improves performance and does not result in data loss.
* Horizontal Scaling:
  * Scaled out nodes function correctly.
  * Removing a node does not result in downtime.
* Adequate unit and functional tests to ensure high quality.
